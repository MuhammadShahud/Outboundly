        <p class="email-text">Hello {$user_name},</p>
        <p class="email-text">Welcome to Outboundly, and congratulations on making the decision to level up your outreach game! We're excited to have you on board and can't wait to see the connections you make with our powerful AI-driven messaging platform.</p>
        <p class="email-text">To help you get started, here's a step-by-step guide on using Outboundly:</p>
        <ol class="email-text steps">
            <li class="step">Visit the LinkedIn profile of the prospect you want to send a message. If you recently installed the extension, refresh the page.</li>
            <li class="step">Choose a messaging mode that best suits your prospecting efforts (e.g., Connection request, Recruiter, etc.) from the Outboundly extension.</li>
            <li class="step">Enter the information requested in the messaging mode and apply settings. You can also choose a previously saved preset for quick messaging.</li>
            <li class="step">Open the message window on the user's profile. This can either be an InMail, direct message, or connection request.</li>
            <li class="step">Click the "Generate" button in the message box to create a hyper-personalized message. Review, edit if needed, and then hit "Send" to connect with your prospect.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="email-text">ðŸ’¡ <span class="note">Things to note:</span></p>
		<ul class="email-text steps">
		<li class="step">If enabled, disable the "press enter to send" on the individual message box by pressing the three dots.</li>
		<li class="step">The more information you provide the AI, the better your messages will be. Provide as many details as possible in your message settings.</li>
		<li class="step">Messages take 5-15 seconds to generate depending on your settings.</li>
		<li class="step">This extension works best on profiles that have a few paragraphs in their about section.</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="email-text">Remember, you have access to 7 powerful messaging modes, including General, Pitch, Template, Connection Request, Recruiter, Custom, Starter, and Brainstorm Modes. Feel free to experiment with these modes to find the one that best suits your needs.</p>
		<p class="email-text">If you need any assistance or have questions about using Outboundly, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team. We're here to help!</p>
